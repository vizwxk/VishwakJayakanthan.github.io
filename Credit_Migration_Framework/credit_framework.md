# Dynamic Credit Migration-Based Trading Framework

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a sophisticated daily credit scoring framework using structural credit models and probabilistic state-switching to enable dynamic CDS and equity trading strategies.

**Innovation:** Integration of KMV (Kealhofer-Merton-Vasicek) model with Hidden Markov Models for real-time credit assessment, combined with TOPSIS methodology for comprehensive credit scoring.

## Abstract

We have developed a dynamic daily credit scoring framework utilizing the Kealhofer-Merton-Vasicek (KMV) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The KMV model calculates the distance to default and default probabilities, which are used as inputs for the HMM. The HMM determines transition and emission probabilities across predefined credit rating states. Following this, a credit score is derived by combining the normalized states with a financial health score obtained from key financial ratios. The final credit score guides a long/short trading strategy in CDS and equities, leveraging market and credit conditions effectively.

## Theoretical Framework

### Research Motivation
Traditional credit ratings are static and lack responsiveness to real-time market changes. This framework addresses the need for:
- **Dynamic Assessment:** Daily credit score updates reflecting current market conditions
- **Quantitative Approach:** Mathematical models replacing subjective rating processes  
- **Trading Integration:** Direct application to CDS and equity trading strategies

## Technical Methodology

### 1. KMV Model Implementation

#### Structural Credit Risk Framework
**Fundamental Assumption:** Firm defaults when asset value falls below liability threshold

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
Asset Value Process: dV = μVdt + σVdW
Equity as Call Option: E = VΦ(d₁) - De^(-rT)Φ(d₂)
```

#### Key Mathematical Formulations

**Distance to Default (DD):**
```
DD = [ln(V/D) + (μ - σ²/2)T] / (σ√T)
```

**Probability of Default (PD):**
```
PD = Φ(-DD)
```

**Where:**
- V = Market value of assets
- D = Default point (STD + 0.5 × LTD)
- μ = Expected asset return
- σ = Asset volatility
- T = Time horizon
- Φ(·) = Cumulative standard normal distribution

#### Asset Value and Volatility Estimation

**Black-Scholes Framework:**
```
E = VΦ(d₁) - De^(-rT)Φ(d₂)

d₁ = [ln(V/D) + (r + σ²/2)T] / (σ√T)
d₂ = d₁ - σ√T
```

**Volatility Relationship:**
```
σₑ = (∂E/∂V) × σ × (V/E) = Φ(d₁) × σ × (V/E)
```

**Iterative Solution Process:**
1. Initial guess for V and σ based on equity and leverage
2. Compute theoretical E and σₑ from guessed parameters
3. Compare with observed market values
4. Update using Newton-Raphson method until convergence

**Validation Insights:**
- Our calculated distance-to-default closely follows Bloomberg's proprietary model
- Bloomberg incorporates qualitative adjustments (e.g., Interest Coverage Ratio)
- Our purely statistical approach maintains strong correlation with market consensus
- Trendline correlation coefficient > 0.85 across all tested companies

### 2. Hidden Markov Model Framework

#### State-Space Modeling
**Hidden States:** 21 discrete credit rating categories (AAA to D)
**Observable Variables:** CDS spreads, inflation rates, treasury yields, KMV metrics

#### Mathematical Formulation

**Model Components:**
- **States (S):** Credit rating categories
- **Observations (O):** Market and economic indicators
- **Transition Matrix (A):** State transition probabilities
- **Emission Matrix (B):** Observation probabilities given states
- **Initial Distribution (π):** Starting state probabilities

**Transition Probabilities:**
```
P(Sₜ = j|Sₜ₋₁ = i) = aᵢⱼ, Σⱼ aᵢⱼ = 1
```

**Emission Probabilities (Gaussian):**
```
P(Oₜ|Sₜ = j) = bⱼ(Oₜ) = (1/√(2πσⱼ²)) exp(-(Oₜ - μⱼ)²/(2σⱼ²))
```

**Forward Algorithm (Likelihood):**
```
P(O|λ) = Σₛ P(O,S|λ)
```

**Viterbi Algorithm (Most Probable Path):**
```
S* = arg max P(S|O, λ)
```

#### Model Training Process
**Baum-Welch Algorithm:**
1. **E-Step:** Calculate forward and backward probabilities
2. **M-Step:** Update transition and emission parameters
3. **Convergence:** Iterate until likelihood improvement < threshold

**Parameter Constraints:**
- Transition probabilities constrained by historical rating migration data
- Emission parameters calibrated to market observables
- State boundaries aligned with standard credit rating scales

### HMM Results and State Evolution

**Key Observations:**
- **Historical Constraints:** Min-max rating bounds ensure realistic predictions
- **Market Sensitivity:** Frequent state changes during stress periods (2008, 2020)
- **Economic Correlation:** State transitions align with macroeconomic cycles
- **Crisis Response:** Models captured credit deterioration during financial crises

### 3. Integrated Credit Scoring Framework

#### Financial Health Score (FHS)

**Input Components:**
- Interest Coverage Ratio: EBIT/Interest Expense
- Total Debt-to-Total Asset Ratio: Total Debt/Total Assets
- Total Debt-to-Total Equity Ratio: Total Debt/Total Equity
- Market Capitalization: Shares Outstanding × Price

**PCA-Based Weighting:**
```
Eigenvalue Decomposition: Σ = PΛP^T
Weights: w = First Principal Component
FHS = Σᵢ wᵢ · xᵢ'
```

Where xᵢ' are Min-Max normalized financial ratios.

#### TOPSIS Credit Score Methodology

**Integration Framework:**
- **Input 1:** Financial Health Score (fundamental analysis)
- **Input 2:** Normalized HMM States (market-based assessment)

**TOPSIS Steps:**
1. **Normalization:** rᵢⱼ = xᵢⱼ / √(Σₘᵢ₌₁ x²ᵢⱼ)
2. **Weighted Matrix:** vᵢⱼ = wⱼ · rᵢⱼ
3. **Ideal Solutions:** v⁺ = max vᵢⱼ, v⁻ = min vᵢⱼ
4. **Separation Measures:** 
   - S⁺ᵢ = √(Σⱼ(vᵢⱼ - v⁺ⱼ)²)
   - S⁻ᵢ = √(Σⱼ(vᵢⱼ - v⁻ⱼ)²)
5. **Final Score:** Cᵢ = S⁻ᵢ/(S⁺ᵢ + S⁻ᵢ)

**Credit Score Scaling:**
```
Final Credit Score = 800 × Cᵢ
```

## Trading Strategy Implementation

### Hedged CDS-Equity Strategy

**Signal Generation Framework:**
- **Credit Scores:** Company-specific creditworthiness (45-day lookback)

```

**Position Logic:**
- **Long CDS + Short Equity:** Signal below threshold (credit deterioration expected)
- **Short CDS + Long Equity:** Signal above threshold (credit improvement expected)

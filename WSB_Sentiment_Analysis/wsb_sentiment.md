# WallStreetBets Sentiment Analysis and Market Correlation Study

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Analyze the relationship between retail investor sentiment on r/WallStreetBets and stock price movements using big data processing and natural language processing techniques.

**Scale:** 33.4 million Reddit comments from 2005-2021, processed using distributed computing framework for comprehensive sentiment analysis and market correlation study.

**Key Innovation:** Large-scale sentiment analysis using PySpark and Spark NLP to identify correlation patterns between retail sentiment and stock performance during significant market events including the GameStop short squeeze and COVID-19 pandemic.

## Abstract

This project explores the intricate relationship between retail investor sentiment expressed on r/WallStreetBets and actual stock price movements. Using advanced big data processing techniques, we analyzed 33.4 million Reddit comments spanning 16 years to understand how social media sentiment correlates with market performance. The study focuses on popular stocks including Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, GameStop, Amazon, and Netflix, with particular attention to major market events like the GameStop short squeeze and COVID-19 market impact.
